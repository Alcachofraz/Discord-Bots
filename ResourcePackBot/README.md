# Minecraft Server Resource Pack Bot

Bot to accept Discord attachments and send them to Dropbox path.
This bot was used for minecraft. Players would go to Discord and send custom textures to a designated channel. The bot would send those files to Dropbox and add them to the resource pack that's being hosted there.
In short, this allows for players to dynammically add textures to a minecraft server resource pack.

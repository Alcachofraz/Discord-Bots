# Secret Friend Bot

## 1. Introduction

Christmas time!
Ever get tired of giving presents to every single member of your family? Ever get tired of wasting so much money?

I don't! Not since I've developed this bot.
Now, every Christmas, I roll this bot, and each member of my family gets 2 (this number is changeable) other members names. Those become their **Secret Friends** for the year!

This method surprisingly captivating, since this time of the year achieves a new level of mystery and excitement. Every member of the family will be like: "Who will be giving me presents this year? I can't wait!".


## 2. How does it work?

This bot will take a certain ammount of names and randomise **Secret Friends** for each member of the family.
Users may choose the ammount of people to participate, and the ammount of **Secret Friends** each participant shall have.

The algorithm is similar to writing each participant's name to a different little piece of paper, putting them all inside a cap and shuffling. Then, each member has to take two (assumming they want 2 **Secret Friends**) pieces of paper randomly. Those names become their **Secret Friends**.

But there's a catch. The cap method sometimes can fail. Imagine Arthur is rolling **Secret Friends** with his family. Every participant gets two pieces of paper and Arthur is the last one, but there are only Arthur's pieces of paper left. That's a fail, since Arthur won't be giving presents to himself. We are not narcissistic people!

This bot's algorithm prevents that from happening, and the roll will never fail.

## 3. How can I use it?
